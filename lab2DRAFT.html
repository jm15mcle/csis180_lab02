<h3>Lab 2 Questions</h3>
 <p>by [[Jensen McLenithan]</p>   
      <ol>
<li>Most HTML elements have a start tag and an end tag with text content in between. But, the reading presented several elements that only have one tag (the start tag). Which elements only have one tag and why is it not necessary for them to have end tags.</li>
          <p> Empty Tags - They are nested  </p>
<li>We used a meta tag in lab to defined the character set. Why would HTML allow you to use a different character set? Hint: Think about the fact that HTML is for the <strong>World</strong> Wide Web.</li>
          <p>html may allow you to use a different character set because people around the world use different languages.
<li>A web page title typically appears in two places (in the head using the <code>title</code> tag and in the body using an <code>h1</code> header). What is the difference between these two places and why is it useful to put a meaningful title in both places.</li>
          <p> The title within the title tag is what is displayed at the top of the web browser on the tab when the site is open. The title in the header is what is actually displayed on the page. It is important to have meaningful titles in both places so the user can easily identify where they are and what they are doing. </p>
<li>It is a common convention to name HTML files with all lowercase letters. Why is this convention helpful/useful?</li>
          <p>Most operating sytems are case sensitive</p>
<li>There are certain symbols that cannot be used in a URL. Thus, they should not be used in the name of an HTML file. List five symbols that cannot be used.</li>
          <p> # pound sign, % percent sign, $ dollar sign, `backtick, and ? question mark</p>
<li>Fix the following HTML validation errors
<ul>
<li>&lt;img src="birthday.jpeg" alt="Image of A Birthday Cake"&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;h1&gt;Hello&lt;/h1&gt;</li>
<li>&lt;a href="file.html" title="Home" class="nav_link"&lt;/a&gt;</li>
    <li>&lt;p&gt;First paragraph&lt;p&gt;</p><p>Second paragraph&lt;/p&gt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Compare lab2.html to lab2.pdf.&nbsp; How large is each file?&nbsp; Open each of them in various tools (browser, editor, etc.).&nbsp; How are HTML documents superior to PDF documents?</li>
    <p> The .html file is larger then the .pdf file. The html is more easily oppenable and editiable then the .pdf. A pdf is like a photocopy of the code that can't be changed or updated. You need aditional software to view a PDF like Adobe but not to view an html doc. </p>
